DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

Used to decouple your entity layer from API requests/responses

Helps avoid exposing sensitive or unnecessary data

Makes validation and data shaping easier

Typically done before or alongside building REST controllers or
API responses to separate entity models from external API contracts.
