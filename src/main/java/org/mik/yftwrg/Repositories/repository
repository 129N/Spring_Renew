When Do You Add Custom Query Methods?
You should add custom methods only when:

You need to query by specific fields (e.g., findByEmail, findByType)

You need to join/filter with specific criteria

You should add @Query or @Modifying queries when:

You need custom complex SQL

You want to perform batch updates, deletes, joins not directly supported by method naming
