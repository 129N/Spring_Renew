Role of EntityMapper Interface
bridge btw Service and Controllers
Single responsibility:
Define a common contract for mapping between
Entity (JPA domain model) and DTO (Data Transfer Object).




Generalization & Reusability
-By using generics (<D extends AbstractDTO, E extends BaseEntity>), you define one interface to serve many pairs of DTOs and Entities.
-Promotes code reuse for all common conversion patterns.
-Reduces duplication across your concrete mappers (EventMapper, VenueMapper, etc.).


3. Decouples Business Logic from Data Mapping
-Keeps your Service classes clean â€” they focus on logic, not conversion.
-You can test mapping logic independently.
-If DTOs or Entities change, only the mapper is affected, not your business logic.
