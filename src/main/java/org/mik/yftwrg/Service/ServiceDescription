 package — Business Logic Layer
This layer:

Acts as a bridge between controller and repository

Handles operations like save, update, delete, find, or any internal logic.


NO ABSTRACTSERVICE: no need to create unless,
You want to extract shared logic (e.g., findById(), save(), delete()) for all services

You’re working on a large project with many similar services

In your case, creating EventService, VenueService, etc.,
    without any shared abstract base class is totally fine and
     actually clearer for learning and smaller projects.


     Why use Interface + Implementation?
     Using interface + implementation pattern gives you:

     Loose coupling: You can swap out implementations (e.g., for testing, alternate strategies)

     Better testing: You can mock the interface in unit tests

     Cleaner code structure: Easier to maintain and scale as your app grows
